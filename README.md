# UFO Sightings
## Overview
Are we alone in the universe? We have designed an interactive webpage that attempts to answer that question. The wepage allows the user to search for UFO sightings in various geographical locations. The user has access to a table of UFO sighting data, and they have the option to filter the data by date of the sighting, city, state, country, duration, and even by shape of the UFO. We designed and modified the appearance of the webpage through use of JavaScipt, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

Here is what our table looks like when it is completely unfiltered. You can see on the left side of the webpage, the user has options to search sightings by date, city, state, country, shape, and duration. In the search box for each filter is just placeholder text. If the user wanted to use the filters, all they would have to do is type in the appropriate box the revelvant information they are looking for. The following is an example of what a search might look like:

Here, we searched for all UFO sightings on 1/10/2010 in San Jacinto, CA. There was only one sighting on that date in that city, and it lasted only 5 seconds.

## Summary

### Drawbacks:
* One major drawback to this webpage is that the user has to type in the filter information exactly as it is in the data base, meaning spelling must be correct, as well as case. So, for San Jacinto, in the data base it is all lowercase, "san jacinto". If the user types in "San Jacinto" they won't get results. The same applies for all filiters. For example, "1/10/2010" cannot be entered as "01/10/2010" or "1/10/10".

### Recommendations:
* A major step in making this webpage more user friendly would be to have a drop-down menu for the filters, in addition to the input box. The input box is nice to have if someone is researching a sighting and they know the exact date, location, etc. But for the more curious users who are a little more aimless in their searches, it would be nice for them to be given filter options so they can more freely explore the data.
* For convenience, the inclusion of a "clear all" button for the filters would make thigns a little easier. Instead of having the user manually clear out each box every time they want to search for a different sighting, they could just click on the button and the page will do it for them.
